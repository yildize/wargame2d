### TACTICAL GUIDE FOR 2D COMBAT GRID GAME

## VICTORY CONDITION
Destroy enemy AWACS while protecting yours. Time costs resources - aggressive progress required.

## CORE PRINCIPLES

### 1. AWACS PROTECTION (TOP PRIORITY)
- Keep AWACS at maximum rear distance with clear escape routes
- Maintain 2+ unblocked retreat paths at all times
- Position multiple defensive layers between AWACS and threats
- Never expose AWACS unless victory is guaranteed

### 2. INFORMATION WARFARE
- Radar detection is SHARED across team - maximize coverage, minimize overlap
- Position units to cover maximum grid area (redundant detection wastes positioning)
- Use decoys to probe unknown areas and reveal enemy SAM positions
- Push radar forward for early warning of enemy advances

### 3. TARGET PRIORITY
1. Enemy AWACS (if accessible - game-winning)
2. Enemy aircraft threatening your AWACS
3. Enemy SAMs blocking your advance path
4. Enemy decoys (LOWEST - avoid wasting ammunition)

### 4. AMMUNITION ECONOMY
- Fire at closer range for higher hit probability
- Coordinate multi-unit strikes on tough targets (avoid overkill)
- Don't waste missiles on suspected decoys
- Each shot counts - make them matter

### 5. SAM TACTICS
- **Stealth Positioning:** Keep SAMs OFF until optimal moment
- **Ambush Pattern:** Toggle ON → Shoot → Toggle OFF immediately
- **Cooldown Safety:** Stay stealthed during ~5-turn reload period
- **Surprise > Sustained Fire:** One good ambush shot beats continuous exposure

### 6. DECOY OPERATIONS
- Mix decoys with real aircraft to create targeting uncertainty
- Use decoys to bait enemy SAMs into revealing positions
- Send decoys ahead to absorb fire and clear paths
- Enemy can't distinguish decoys - exploit this

### 7. FORMATION CONCEPTS
**Defense:** Layered screen with aircraft forward, AWACS back, hidden SAMs for surprise
**Offense:** Decoys on flanks, real aircraft concentrated, probe multiple corridors
**Never:** Cluster all units together (wastes radar coverage + vulnerable to focus fire)

### 8. TEMPO & AGGRESSION
- Static defense loses to operational costs over time
- Apply pressure to force enemy into reactive positions
- Trading 1 aircraft for enemy AWACS = victory
- Once enemy weakened, commit to AWACS strike

### 9. COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID
- Overlapping radar coverage (shared detection makes this wasteful)
- Shooting at maximum range (low hit % wastes precious ammo)
- Single escape route for AWACS (death trap)
- Keeping SAMs constantly ON (makes them easy targets)
- Engaging obvious decoys (ammo waste)
- All units in one corridor (easily blocked/countered)

### 10. WINNING PATTERNS
- **SAM Ambush:** Hide SAM → Enemy enters range → Toggle ON + Shoot → Toggle OFF
- **Decoy Screen:** Decoys lead, aircraft follow 2-3 cells back, exploit cleared path
- **Pincer Movement:** Attack from multiple directions to trap enemy AWACS
- **Breakthrough Timing:** Thin enemy defenses first, then commit to AWACS kill

## DECISION FRAMEWORK EACH TURN
1. Is my AWACS safe? (If no - prioritize defense immediately)
2. Can I damage/kill enemy AWACS? (If yes - consider aggressive strike)
3. What new enemy positions revealed? (Update threat assessment)
4. Which units can contribute to objective? (Advance those, position others)
5. Are SAMs optimally positioned for ambush? (Toggle timing critical)
6. Is ammunition being used efficiently? (High-value targets only)

## REMEMBER
- Every turn costs resources - make progress toward enemy AWACS
- Shared radar = spread units for coverage, don't cluster
- Decoys are disposable intelligence assets - use them
- SAMs are ambush weapons, not frontline fighters
- Close distance before shooting when safe to do so
- Protect AWACS > Everything else
